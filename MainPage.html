      An increasing number of adults have rated their own mental health as poor in the last five years, particularly young adults, say Ontario researchers who call it a troubling trend.

In a survey of adults aged 18 or older in Ontario, 2.2 per cent said they had seriously contemplated suicide in the previous year, according to Thursday’s report from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). It’s the first time that the hospital included a specific question about suicide in its long-standing annual survey.

Self-rated poor mental health rose from 4.7 per cent in 2003 to 7.1 per cent in 2013. The increase was seen among those aged 18 to 29, from about three per cent in 2009 to 12 per cent last year.
