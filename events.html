You’re probably busy, so we’ll get right to it. This week we ask our readers to help us. To protect our independence, we'll never run ads. We survive on donations. Only a tiny portion of our readers give. Now is the time we ask. If everyone reading this gave $3, our fundraiser would be done within an hour. Yep, that’s about the price of buying a programmer a coffee. We’re a small non-profit with costs of a top website: servers, staff and programs. Wikipedia is something special. It is like a library or a public park, a temple for the mind where we can all go to think and learn. When we founded Wikipedia, we could have made it a for-profit company with advertising, but we decided to do something different. Commerce is fine. Advertising is not evil. But it doesn’t belong here. If Wikipedia is useful to you, take one minute to keep it online and ad-free another year.
